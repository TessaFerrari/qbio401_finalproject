# qbio401_finalproject

This repository provides sample-code from a public cancer data analysis project. 
The goal of this project was to look at the survivability of uterine cancer based on patient demographics and certain genetic diseases.
Because of updates to certain packages used during the original analysis, to run as intended the code may need to be altered to meet current package specifications.
